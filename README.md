# 1 General information
"Blog System 2.0" was created in Visual Studio Community by Annice Strömberg, 2020, with [Annice.se](https://annice.se) as the primary download location. In this script, an admin can create, edit and delete blog entries, entry categories and entry comments. The admin can also reply to comments posted by anonymous users. Furthermore, the admin can edit the admin details. Moreover, the script supports a password recovery function to reset the admin password via a token link sent to the admin email.

# 10 Setup guide
As this script was created in Visual Studio Community with SQL Server, I will go through the necessary setup steps accordingly (all softwares used for this application setup are free).

## 10.1 Prerequisites
  * [Install SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/sv-se/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
  * [Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
  * [Install .NET Core 3.1 (SDK)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
  * [Install Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
  
## 10.2 Create the database and its tables
  1. Navigate to the unzipped script folder “BlogSystem2.0”. Open the file “sql_blogsystem.sql”, look up the code section below and change the highlighted values to suit your own settings. (Note! The default password is set to “admin”, but can be changed after your first login):

```sql
INSERT INTO BlogSystem.dbo.BS_Users 
VALUES 
  (
    'YourUserName',
    'YourFirstName', -- Optional.
    'YourLastName', -- Optional.
    'your@email.com', 
    -- Keep the hashed password below until your first login. Default password is set to
    -- "admin", but can be changed under the admin panel once you're logged in:
   'AQAAAAEAACcQAAAAEBehHmgEHZmjXlTBGlKSW9KVuxMIHp1f4r8sC502SFQkGGxiYeef6HFntNMCMdZ76w=='
)

```

2. Once you have updated the SQL code in “sql_blogsystem.sql”, then open and execute the SQL file/code in SQL Server Management Studio to create the BlogSystem database with its tables.

## 10.3 Configure the application
  3. When the database and tables are created, you can open the application in Visual Studio by double clicking the solution file “BlogSystem.sln” under the unzipped project folder path: “BlogSystem2.0 > BlogSystem > BlogSystem.sln”.

  4. In Visual Studio, you can then change the commented values below to suit your own settings in the appsettings.json file found in the Solution Explorer window:
  
```json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DBConnect": "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=BlogSystem;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true" // You can keep this AS-IS unless you use a DB user and DB password.
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "abc123^&%&^&%321", // Name the key with a minium length of 16 characters.
    "Issuer": "BlogSystem2.0", // The token issuer.
    "Audience": "Admin" // The token audience.
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "From": "your@gmail.com",
    "Password": "YourMailPassword",
    "Host": "smtp.gmail.com", // You can keep this if you use gmail.
    "Gmail": "587" // You can keep this if you use gmail.
  }
}
```

## 10.4 NuGet packages
  6. Also, ensure you have the following NuGet packages installed for the solution, otherwise [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell) them:
  
    * Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer (3.1.8)
    * Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (3.1.8)
    * Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (3.1.8)
    * Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design (3.1.4)
    * NonFactors.Grid.Mvc6 (6.2.0)
    * ReflectionIT.Mvc.Pagin (4.0.0)

## 10.5 Run and test the application
  7. Select to run the application via the Visual Studio play button in the top menu bar.

  8. On your first login, use the password "**admin**" along with the user email you specified when you executed the SQL code (see section 10.2).
